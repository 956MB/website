        'I love screen grabbing from things like movies/TV/games, and then using Photoshop or Topaz Photo AI to make them into wallpapers. I also feel a great urge to share them with others since I think they\'re so cool, and most things arent natively in 6K (yet). Hopefully this section comes across as a "public repo" of sorts for cool wallpapers and stuff, and not me trying to claim all these as my own works (obviously except for the ones I actually did make myself).',
